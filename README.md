Node Express Handlebars

This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. 
Node and MySQL are used to query and route data.
Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.

####How it works:

Eat-the-Burger allows users to input their favorite burgers, and then devour them. 

When the user submits a new burger it waits in the left side of the page until the devour button is clicked. Once clicked, the burger moves to the right. 

Each burger is logged in the database.
